Pipfrosch jQuery
================

Plugin for modern jQuery in WordPress.

Originally my `piptheme` WordPress theme that is __not__ distributed through
WordPress contained an updated jQuery. I decided that was the wrong way to go
about it.

jQuery sometimes has important security updates. Therefore it is important that
updates to jQuery be made available when new releases are available and as such
it would be better for jQuery to updated in a separate plugin from the theme,
preferably a plugin that can be updated through WordPress itself.

This is an attempt to create such a plugin with needed bells and whistles to do
that. It is not yet ready for submission to their repository.

See the `readme.txt` file.
